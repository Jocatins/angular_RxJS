# RXJS

A brief note on RxJS

`RxJS` is a library for reactive programming using observables.
This programming paradigm allows developers to handle async requests in a more
elegant and manageable way.
observables are the basic building blocks of RxJS, and they are a way to represent a stream
of data over time.

# Basic Concepts

`Observables`.

-   An observable is a data stream that emits values over time.

`Operators`

-   Operators are functions that allow us to transform, filter or combine Observables.
    There are many in-built operators, and we can also create our own custom operators.

`Subjects`

-   Subjects are a special type of Observables that allows us to both emit and observe values.
